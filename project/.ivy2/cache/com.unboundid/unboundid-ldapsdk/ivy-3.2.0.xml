		The UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java is a fast, comprehensive, and easy-to-use
      Java API for communicating with LDAP directory servers and performing
      related tasks like reading and writing LDIF, encoding and decoding data
      using base64 and ASN.1 BER, and performing secure communication.  This
      package contains the Standard Edition of the LDAP SDK, which is a
      complete, general-purpose library for communicating with LDAPv3 directory
      servers.
